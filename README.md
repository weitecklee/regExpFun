This was made as part of a presentation on regular expressions.

Most of the files were made for testing purposes. Really, the only file that you may be concerned with is *quiz.js*.

You can just copy the contents of *quiz.js* and save it locally, then run `node quiz.js` in your terminal.
I specifically wrote the code to not require any external libraries.

Have fun!
